#  Netflix Dataset Cleaning Project

##  Objective
The goal of this project was to clean and prepare a raw Netflix dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, standardizing formats, and ensuring consistency across the data for further analysis or modeling.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
-  Visual Studio Code
---

##  Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about Netflix Movies and TV Shows, with columns such as:
- `show_id`
- `type`
- `title`
- `director`
- `cast`
- `country`
- `date_added`
- `release_year`
- `rating`
- `duration`
- `listed_in`
- `description`

---

##  Data Cleaning Steps

### 1. **Missing Value Handling**
- Filled missing `director` with `"Unknown"`.
- Filled missing `cast` with `"Not Available"`.
- Filled missing `country` with the most frequent value (mode).
- Filled missing `rating` with `"Not Rated"`.
- Dropped rows with missing `date_added` and `duration`.

### 2. **Duplicate Handling**
- Checked for duplicates using `df.duplicated().sum()` â†’  No duplicates found.

### 3. **Standardization**
- Column names converted to lowercase with underscores.
- Stripped whitespace and standardized casing for columns like `type`, `country`, `rating`, etc.

### 4. **Date Format Handling**
- Converted `date_added` to `datetime` format.
- Created a formatted date string column: `date_added_ddmmyyyy` (in dd-mm-yyyy format).

### 5. **Data Type Corrections**
- Ensured `release_year` is of type `int`.
- Ensured `duration` is treated as a `str`.

### 6. **Feature Engineering**
- Extracted numeric part of duration into `duration_num`.
- Extracted time unit (e.g., "min", "season") into `duration_type`.

##  Final Outcome
- Cleaned, structured, and well-prepared dataset.
- Ready for EDA, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

## ðŸ§  Conclusion
This project demonstrates fundamental data preprocessing steps required for real-world datasets. By resolving inconsistencies, handling nulls, and engineering useful features, the dataset is now in excellent shape for insights and predictive modeling.
